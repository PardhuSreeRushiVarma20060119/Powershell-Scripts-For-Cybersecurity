Thanks for your interest in contributing to this PowerShell-based cybersecurity toolkit!  
This project welcomes contributions that improve, extend, or harden scripts for ethical red teaming, blue teaming, auditing, and reconnaissance.

## 🧠 Before You Start

- 💡 All contributions must be **ethical** and intended for **educational or authorized security research only**.

## 📂 Script Structure Guidelines

- PowerShell files must use the `.ps1` extension.
- Include inline comments for any complex logic.
- Keep each script focused on a **single purpose**.
- Avoid hardcoded values where parameters can be used.
- Use built-in PowerShell cmdlets; avoid third-party binaries unless absolutely necessary.
